\section{Background}
Poker software has been developed before by multiple companies, but these
are all mostly commercial, closed source software, with no discussion of the
algorithms and design decisions that went into them. This project will go
into depth on some of the issues that are faced when converting the game of
poker from the table to the computer.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Each player is dealt two cards, and the player to the left of the dealer must
pay a small bet, called the small blind, with the player to his left paying 
double this bet, the big blind. Play then proceeds clockwise from the next
player. Each player has the option to fold, check, call, raise, or go all in,
depending upon the circumstances. Folding forfeits any stake in the round, and
removes you from play. Checking means you wish not to bet, and is only
available if there is no current bet which needs matching. Calling means to
match the current bet, and raising means to raise the current bet to a higher
value. Going all in means to bet all your chips, and sometimes is mandatory to
remain in the pot, if you have less chips than the current bet. This can cause
multiple side pots to occur. Each player has an amount of chips at the 
beginning of the game which they bet with, these may be backed by real money as
is the case in casinos and most online poker software. Once all players have
matched the current bet or folded, three table cards are revealed, called
the flop. These are common to all players hands, and may be used along with
the players two hidden cards to form the best 5 card hand. A further two table
cards will be revealed as play continues, unless all players but one fold,
leaving the winner to keep any bet chips. Again, players may bet if they wish.
Providing there are still players in play, the fourth card will be revealed, 
called the turn. The same process occurs again, then the fifth card will be
revealed, the river. Once this betting round has ended, any players still
in play reveal their cards, and the winner is the player who has the best
five card hand. These can vary from simple pairs, to higher valued hands such
as a straight, which is five cards in a row, such a 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. The winner
receives all the chips in the middle of the table gained from other players
bets, and a new round begins, with the dealer moving to the next player on the
left.
