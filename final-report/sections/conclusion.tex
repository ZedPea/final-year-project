\section{Conclusion}
In conclusion, we have walked through the development of the poker server,
client, and testing programs. The software developed has been rigorously
tested through the use of white box, functional testing, and black box
automated testing. The shuffle algorithms and random sources have been heavily
investigated, to determine the cycle lengths, card distribution, and bit size.
We have also investigated how different algorithms and random sources can
effect win rate over a large amount of poker games. The GUI has been
methodically designed for ease of use, and has been reiterated to generated
a clean and usable final solution. Finally, a few simple rule based AI's have
been created to both allow users to test their skills and to allow automated
testing of the server interface.
