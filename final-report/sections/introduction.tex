\section{Introduction}
This project sets out to investigate the effect of randomness on an online
poker game. Multiple different sources of randomness have been assessed, along
with different methods of shuffling. These will be compared both by looking
at the algorithms cycle lengths and bit size, and they will be automatically
tested through the use of AI to automate large amounts of poker games.
In addition, the distribution of cards via a shuffle tester will be
demonstrated, which highlights the effects of small differences in shuffle
algorithms.
