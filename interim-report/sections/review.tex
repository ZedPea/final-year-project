\section{Project Management Review}

As outlined in the initial report, a timeplan was created with a suggested
schedule and order to complete certain tasks of the project. We can now
evaluate this to see our current progress. In the below chart, (S) = Server, 
(C) = Client. Bars labelled green are tasks that have been completed, and
bars labelled red are tasks that have not been completed yet.

% annoyingly i have to specify an adjustwidth for every chart, leaving any out
% causes incorrect indentation, possibly due to internal indentation in the

As the current week is week 19, we can see that the project is right on
schedule as expected, and the timeplan appears to have been calculated
accurately. However, due to not being ahead of schedule, any unforeseen delays
could potentially cause the project to fall behind and not be completed to a
satisfactory level. The AI is also a large chunk of the project, and if this
is not completed it will be quite troublesome. To some extent, having a simple
AI that will be implemented will offset this risk, allowing an AI to be
submitted for the final software, albeit one not as complex as hoped for.
