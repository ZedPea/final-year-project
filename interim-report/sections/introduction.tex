\section{Introduction}
This report will set out to detail the developed software: A poker server,
client with GUI, and a simplistic AI\@. 

Two other GUI interfaces were developed to demonstrate the shuffling and
hand dealing process. The shuffle tester allows multiple hands to be dealt 
using different card picking algorithms, and different sources of randomness.
The number of hands dealt is also configurable. It then creates a graph 
showing a visual representation of the number of cards dealt, allowing a
cursory analysis to tell if a given shuffle is heavily biased, or not.
The second program allows the server to have its card picking algorithm
and random source changed mid game, allowing observers to view its effect
upon the gameplay.

The reasons behind design and architectural choices, along with evidence to 
support these, assisted by the extra programs will be detailed. Sections 
covered  will be the GUI design, the gameplay, and an in depth look at 
randomness and card generation. The time plan for completing the software
and the current position will be evaluated, to ensure the project is on
track for being completed in the given timeframe.
