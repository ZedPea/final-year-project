\section{Introduction}
This report will set out to detail the developed software: A poker server,
client with GUI, and test programs to illustrate the performance of different
card picking algorithms and sources of randomness. The reasons behind design
and architectural choices, along with evidence to support these, assisted by
the extra programs will be detailed. Sections covered will be the current
progression of the project according to the previously created time plan, the
gameplay, creating an online poker GUI interface and feel, and an in depth
look at randomness, pseudo-random number generation, card generation, the
correctness of the deal, and shuffle bias.
