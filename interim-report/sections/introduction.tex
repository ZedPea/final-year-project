\section{Introduction}
This report will set out to detail the developed software: A poker server,
client with GUI, and a simplistic AI\@. Test programs were also developed
to illustrate the performance of different card picking algorithms and sources
of randomness. The reasons behind design and architectural choices, along with 
evidence to support these, assisted by the extra programs will be detailed. 
Sections covered will be the current progression of the project according to
the previously created time plan, the gameplay, the GUI interface, and an in 
depth look at randomness and card generation.
