\section{Introduction}
This report will cover the aim of the project, background information, and the timescale for the development of the accompanying software.
As the title states, the developed software will comprise multiple inter operable sub projects, a server, a client, and an AI\@.

By creating the aforementioned programs, the project will intend to evaluate the use of Haskell\cite{hudak1992} in creating large software projects spanning a range of areas, specifically in AI development and interconnected systems.

Poker has been chosen as the target game for this software, as due to being an imperfect information game\cite{sandholm2010}, is challenging for Artificial Intelligence to solve.
In addition, the game features significantly detailed rules and game play progression to ensure the developed solution demonstrates feasible methods for managing the complexity.

Proposed software and libraries to handle the above issues will be discussed, along with reasoning behind the language choice.

A suggested task list and time frame will be outlined, to ensure that the project remains on schedule.

Finally, a risk analysis will be showcased, to attempt to deal with the inherent dangers that come with developing software, such as data loss.
