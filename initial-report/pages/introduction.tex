\section{Introduction}
The developed software will comprise multiple inter operable sub projects, a server, a client, and an AI\@.

The project will intend to evaluate the use of Haskell \parencite{hudak1992} in creating large software projects spanning a range of areas, specifically in AI development and interconnected systems.

Poker has been chosen as the target game for this software, as due to being an imperfect information game \parencite{sandholm2010}, is challenging for Artificial Intelligence to solve.

In addition, certain aspects of Poker are interesting to explore, for example demonstrating that random picking or shuffling of cards is indeed random, and not slightly gamed by the software.
